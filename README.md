# Workshop_Pyramid

## Introduction

Welcome to our Workshop, today we will see how to create a to-do list application web using [Python](https://python.org/) with the framework [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) and the database [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).\
We hope that you will enjoy and learn as much as you can during this workshop ! :)

## Prerequisites

### **What we need ?**
For this workshop you will need to have **Python** installed on your computer. If it's not already done, you can find the installation [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
We also need to install a database, in our case we will use SQLite so you can download it from the package manager of your machine.


### **How to build** :
You have to configure an environment. Then let's create a virtual environment:
```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
```

Once your virtual env is created, you can install the required packages provide by the requirements.txt file:
```sh
    venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can launch your web application:
```sh
    venv/bin/python3 main.py
```
